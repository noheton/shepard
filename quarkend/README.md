# quarkend

> **Experimental project:** We are in the process of migrating the backend under `backend/` to use quarkus in this directory.

This is the new backend based on Quarkus.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## IDE Setup

### IntelliJ

1. In the "Project Structure" settings go to "Modules" (or press F4).
2. Click "+" and "Import Module".
3. Select the "quarkend" folder.
4. Select "Import Module from External Model".
5. Select "Maven" and create.
6. Click ok to save the new module.
7. Wait for indexing of files.
8. Afterwards you can use the existing run configuration on the top right to run quarkus.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_** Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory. Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkend-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
