# 86 — UI Change Log

**Purpose.** Living changelog for user-visible frontend changes in this fork.
Every PR that ships a UI change adds one row.  Follows the same discipline
as `aidocs/34` (admin-facing upgrade path) and `aidocs/44` (feature matrix)
but focused on the researcher/user experience layer.

**Audience.** Contributors, UX reviewers.
**Relates to.** `aidocs/ops/85-ui-overhaul-design.md`, `aidocs/34`, `aidocs/44`.
